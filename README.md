# 2dMagneticFlow
Scripts that produce pictures and videos of the motion of a charged particle under a magnetic field.

Important notice:
Please recall that in 2d a magnetic field is a scalar field, i.e. a function. Not an actual vector field.

Script-by-script description:

magpicture - Creates an image of the orbit of a charged particle under a chosen magnetic field.

maganimation - Creates a video of the orbit of a charged particle under a chosen magnetic field.

biotSavart - Integrates the Biot-Savart formula numerically for a wire around the unit circle with constant current through it. It also determines its assymptotic growth at the boundary.
